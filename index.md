## About Me

I am a PhD student at the University of Central Florida working under Dr. Di Wu in the [Unary Lab](https://www.unarylab.com/).
My interests are currently in GPUs and GPU systems for serving and training AI models.
I'm excited to be a part of this era in computing and to help design hardware and systems for the future of computing.

In my free time I enjoy recreational programming, as well as swimming and weightlifting.
